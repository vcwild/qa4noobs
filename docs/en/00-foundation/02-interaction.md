# **Interaction with the Team**

- Agile Principles

1. Face-to-face Communication: The most effective communication method is in person. Unlike the traditional model where the tester had limited access to other team members, here, developers and testers work side by side.
2. Continuous Feedback: Working in sprints involves constant testing, providing immediate and progressive feedback to the team.
3. Continuous Improvement: Both in processes and people, values of transparency, professional development.
4. Have Courage
5. Deliver Value to the Customer: Testers need to be close to the customer, understand their needs, and translate them into business-focused test scenarios.
6. Keep it Simple: The nature of testing is to validate various aspects, but simplification and prioritization based on customer needs are necessary. Use lighter tools to optimize the development process.
7. Respond to Changes: Adaptability to new scenarios and conditions that may occur during sprints, learning new skills and attitudes to become adaptable.
8. Self-Organization: Agile teams self-organize to solve a problem in the best way, considering each team member's skills. This dynamic emerges from the team itself, requiring autonomy and collaboration with the team's purpose.
9. People Focus: Agile methodology is more about people, the human factor, than methodological and bureaucratic factors. Apply all other principles and stay close to other team members for collaboration.
10. Have Fun

In this context, the tester plays an active and fundamental role in the product development process, from understanding business rules to delivering the complete product.

They must add value by being a quality reference, serving the team and the customer, using their critical and analytical skills to find solutions to the team's problems.
