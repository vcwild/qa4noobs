# **Tools and Their Objectives**

The main tools used in the process are subdivided into categories, according to the objective of each one.

## **Categories of Tools**

- **Project Management and Version Control Tools:**

Used throughout the development process, from defining requirements and versioning them for staging, to project versioning for secure and risk-free implementation.

Version control is applied to create stable releases for client delivery, while unvalidated development is restricted to test branches. This ensures there is always a stable, bug-free, and validated version in case an implemented feature breaks the code.

### **Test and Defect Management Tools**

- **Test Management:**
  TestLink allows the creation of test cases and manages their execution, helping identify failed or successful tests. It also assists in assigning tests among team members and supervising the execution.

- **Defect Management:**
  Enables describing the found flaw, assigning severity, work allocation among team members, development tracking, separation by status, inclusion of test evidence, etc.

### **Test Automation Tools**

Test automation tools are used for executing repetitive tests that do not require human intervention, such as interface tests, integration tests, performance tests, security tests, regression tests, etc. It is a broad concept, varying between programming languages and different methodologies for automating manual tests.

### **Performance Testing**

Some performance testing tools include:

- **JMeter:** Allows the creation of test scripts and simulation of various users, monitoring response time, service errors, and providing multiple reports.

- **Gatling:** Monitors the application continuously and alerts upon detecting errors and slowdowns.

- **LoadComplete:** Combines both functions by allowing script creation and continuous performance monitoring.

- **BlazeMeter:** Enables the creation of test scripts and user simulation from various servers worldwide.

### **Supporting Tools**

May or may not be used; they formalize the process, performing similar functions as management tools.
