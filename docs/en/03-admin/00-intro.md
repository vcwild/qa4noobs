# Project Management

A project is a temporary undertaking with the goal of creating a unique product, service, or outcome.

The project is temporary because it has defined start and end dates, and it is unique because it involves a set of operations designed to achieve the objective.

Project management is the discipline of planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve the project's objectives while keeping in mind the scope, time, quality, and costs.

This facilitates the workflow of the team of collaborators.
