# Kanban

Kanban is a popular framework used to implement Agile and DevOps software development, requiring real-time communication of capacity and work transparency.

Work items are visually represented on a Kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of each project sector at any given time.

## What Is a Kanban Board

It is an Agile project management tool that aids in clear project visualization, maximizing efficiency (or flow).

This aids both Agile and DevOps teams in their day-to-day work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help service and technology teams engage in the right amount of work.

## Elements of a Kanban Board

Boards can be divided into five components:

1. Visual Signals;
2. Columns;
3. Work in Progress (WIP) Limits;
4. Commitment Point;
5. Delivery Point;

### 1. Visual Signals

One of the first noticeable elements on the board is visual cards (stickers, tickets, etc.). Kanban teams write all their projects and work items on cards, usually one per card. Once on the board, these visual signals help team members and stakeholders quickly understand what the team is focusing on.

### 2. Columns

Another hallmark of the Kanban board is the Columns. Each column represents a specific activity that, together, forms a workflow.

Cards flow through this workflow until they are complete.

Workflows can be as simple as "To Do," "In Progress," "Done," or much more complex.

### 3. Work in Progress (WIP) Limits

The maximum number of cards that can be in a column at any time. A column with a WIP limit of three cannot contain more than three cards.

When the column reaches its maximum, the team must focus on these cards to move them forward, making room for new cards to enter this stage of the workflow.

These WIP limits are critical for exposing production bottlenecks and maximizing flow. WIP limits provide advance warnings that you have taken on too much work.

### 4. Commitment Point

Kanban teams usually have a backlog on their boards. This is where customers and team partners enter project ideas that the team can take on when ready. The commitment point is when an idea is taken on by the team, and work begins on the project.

### 5. Delivery Point

It is the end of the workflow for a Kanban team.

For most teams, the delivery point is when the product or service is in the hands of the customer. The team's goal is to take the cards from commitment to delivery as quickly as possible. The time between these two points can be called Lead Time, and Kanban teams continuously strive to improve and minimize this time.

Jim Benson says that Kanban has only two rules:

"Limit WIP and visualize your work. If you start with just these two rules and apply them to your work, your Kanban board will be quite different from the one described above. And that's okay!"

## Types and Examples of Kanban Boards

Kanban can be adapted to various environments, from manufacturing to human resources, from Agile to DevOps.

The type of environment adapting Kanban often dictates whether the board is physical or digital.

## Physical Boards

The simplest Kanban boards are physical boards divided into columns. Teams mark the board with Post-its, which move through the workflow, showing progress.

An advantage of physical boards is that "it's always on." You can't open a new tab on a huge whiteboard right next to your desk.

It is simple and easy to set up, but sometimes the physical screen is not ideal for remote teams.

## Digital Boards

While the Kanban system gained popularity with software and engineering teams, it has suffered.

Digital boards allow teams that do not share physical spaces to use Kanban boards remotely and asynchronously.

The Trello platform provides a quick and easy way to create virtual Kanban boards.

The advantages of a virtual Kanban board include setup speed, ease of sharing, and the asynchronous nature of the countless conversations and comments throughout the project. No matter where or when project members check the board, they will see the most up-to-date status. In addition, you can use a Trello built-in workflow for your personal tasks.

## Kanban vs Scrum

The differences between Kanban and Scrum are quite subtle. In most interpretations, Scrum teams use a Kanban board but with Scrum processes, artifacts, and roles within it. However, there are key differences:

- Scrum sprints have start and end dates, while Kanban is a continuous process.
- Team roles are clearly defined in Scrum (Product Owner, developers, Scrum Master), while Kanban has no formal roles. Both teams are well-organized.
- A Kanban board is used throughout the project lifecycle, while a Scrum board is cleared and recycled after each sprint.
- Scrum boards have a fixed number of tasks and set delivery dates.
- Kanban boards are more flexible regarding tasks and time limits. Tasks can be reprioritized, reassigned, or updated as needed.

Both Kanban and Scrum are popular Agile frameworks among software developers.

## Starting a Kanban Board

Kanban is a "start with what you know" method. This means you don't have to figure out what to do next to start Kanban. The method assumes three things:

1. You understand the current processes as they are applied and respect the current roles, responsibilities, and hierarchies.
2. You agree to pursue continuous improvement through evolutionary change.
3. You encourage acts of leadership at all levels, from team members to senior managers.
