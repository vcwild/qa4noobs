# Non-Functional Testing

Non-functional testing is a type of technique to test non-functional parameters such as reliability, load testing, performance, and software responsiveness.

The primary purpose is to test the system's read speed under non-functional parameters.

These parameters are **never** tested before functional tests.

It is essential to confirm that the reliability and functionality, the software's requirement specifications serve as the basis for this testing method, enabling QA teams to check if the system complies with user requirements.

Increasing the usability, effectiveness, maintainability, and portability of the product are the goals of non-functional testing. This helps decrease manufacturing risks associated with non-functional components of the product.

## Characteristics of Non-Functional Testing

Non-functional testing is characterized by:

- Being quantifiable, hence adjectives like "good," "better," etc., do not apply to this type of testing;
- Exact numbers are unlikely to be known at the beginning of the requirement process;
- Prioritizing requirements is crucial;
- Ensuring that in software engineering, quality attributes are identified accurately;

## Non-Functional Test Conditions

Non-functional test conditions define the following parameters:

- **Security:** Specifies how a system is protected from planned or unplanned intrusions from internal or external sources;
- **Reliability:** The consistency with which a system completes tasks without error;
- **Efficiency:** The capacity, quantity, and response time that software can support;
- **Usability:** The simplicity with which a user can engage with a system, learn how to use it, and prepare inputs and outputs;
- **Availability:** Establishes the user's reliance on the system during operation;
- **Scalability:** Describes how much a program can increase its processing power to support growing demand.

## Advantages of Non-Functional Testing

It has the following benefits:

- Offers a high level of security;
- Ensures the system's capability for simultaneous users;
- Enhances system efficiency;
- There is no need to write test cases more than once as they are never altered;
- Compared to other testing procedures, it has a shorter time commitment.
